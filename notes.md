Cloud computing

- Utility computing
  - The illusion of infinite computing resources
  - Both hardware and software
- Based on large data centers
  - Economies of scale - If you have a large production setup, you can make one more product very easily.
- Scale-up (or Scale-down) with minimum effort

  - Only pay for what you use.

- Corporate Data centers

  - Owned by companies

- Edge: Server computing near the users.

  - E.g.: A few server racks on the towers.

- Canary systems: The cloud providers keep sending out notices that they don't share anything with the government, once they do, you should know that the cloud services provider has to comply with a subpoena.

- Auction edge server resources: An edge client (mobile/cell phone) wants to use an API and would have to pay for it. But if there was an auction which offers the service (API) to the users by letting them place bids, the API provider will know if someone would like to pay more for the service.
  - But you can't place a high bid, because that's called a untruthful bid, and the only entity losing money would be the user.
  - You can place a lower bid, but the probability of it getting selected is lower.

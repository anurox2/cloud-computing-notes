# Intro

- Attacks growing exponentially
  - Very difficult to combat for emerging networked cyber physical systems(CPS) & IoT
- Wireless networks
  - Primary communication media for CPS and IoT
  - Highly vulnerable due to open nature of communication (wireless data can be captured while its being transmitted, all you need is a receiver).
- Evaluate performance of cyber deception system
  - Combat cyber adversaries
  - In a virtual wireless networking simulation
  - SDN controller creates MVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network Operators)
  - Cyber deception system:
    - Continuously analyses the network
    - Observes the connections
    - Creates deceptive MVNOs to lure and direct adversaries away from the real users
  - The deceptive MVNO can be used to analyse the adversary's patterns, capabilities, intent.
  - This protects the real users.
  - The results of the Monte Carlo simulations were used as a benchmark for the proposed approach's performance.
